#Unspell keyboard by squizzler

This is a layout of Unspell symbols. Unspell is a phonetic script for written English. The necessary font and more details including a cribsheet on how to read and write it are at [unspell blog](http://unspell.blogspot.com/p/home.html)

This particular prototype uses layers to provide a system by which the typist modifies the basic shapes.

In Unspell, vowels are short or long (stressed),and this is implemented here using "tap-dance" whereby double tapping the vowel "stresses" it.

Unspell and its symbols are the copyright of its inventor Dimitry Orlov.
